# asteroids

Simple asteroids clone using the p5 library.
It's actually an old project I rewrote to practice refactoring and see how I like working with OLOO style code.
p5 doesn't seem to scale very well and I would probably interface with canvas directly if the goal was to deploy in production.

## Getting Started

1.  `git clone https://github.com/carlhueffmeier/asteroids.git`
2.  `cd asteroids`
3.  `npm install`
4.  `npm start`
5.  Open [`http://localhost:8080/`](http://localhost:8080/)
